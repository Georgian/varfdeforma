# "Vârf de Formă" 

> Prod: https://varfdeforma.ro
> Rougly translated to "Peak Performance", VDF is a personal project written with love and care written in little spare time. 

## Tech stack

Frontend is VueJS with a few additional plugins, and it's communicating with a Spring backend. 
These two reside entirely on AWS services. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8082
npm run dev
```
